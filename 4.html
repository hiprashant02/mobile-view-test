    <h1>1.4 France Abolishes Monarchy and Becomes a Republic</h1>

    <h2>1.4.1 The National Assembly</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1791:</strong> The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution.</li>
        <li>The main objective was to limit the powers of the monarch and establish a constitutional monarchy.</li>
        <li>The new constitution gave the power to make laws to the National Assembly, which was elected by a group of active citizens.</li>
        <li><span class="special-word">Active Citizens:</span> Only men above 25 years of age who paid taxes equivalent to at least 3 days of a laborer's wage were considered active citizens and could vote.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.4.2 The Reign of Terror</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1793-1794:</strong> A period known as the Reign of Terror under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre.</li>
        <li>Robespierre followed a policy of severe control and punishment to defend the republic from its enemies.</li>
        <li>Thousands of suspected enemies were arrested, tried, and executed by the guillotine.</li>
        <li><span class="special-word">Guillotine:</span> A device used during the French Revolution for beheading people, seen as a symbol of the Reign of Terror.</li>
        <li>Robespierre's policies included rationing of bread, use of revolutionary tribunals, and a system of revolutionary laws.</li>
        <li>Robespierre was eventually arrested and executed in July 1794, ending the Reign of Terror.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.4.3 The Directory Rules France</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After the fall of Robespierre, a new constitution was introduced in 1795.</li>
        <li>It provided for two elected legislative councils which appointed an executive body known as the Directory.</li>
        <li>The Directory was made up of five members and was meant to prevent the concentration of power in one individual.</li>
        <li>However, the Directory faced constant conflicts with the legislative councils and was unable to solve the economic crises.</li>
        <li>This political instability paved the way for the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte.</li>
    </ul>
