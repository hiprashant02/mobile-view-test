    <h1>1.2 French Society During the Late Eighteenth Century</h1>

    <h2>1.2.1 The Three Estates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>French society in the late eighteenth century was divided into three estates.</li>
        <li><span class="special-word">The First Estate:</span> Comprised of the clergy. They enjoyed certain privileges, such as exemption from paying taxes.</li>
        <li><span class="special-word">The Second Estate:</span> Made up of the nobility. They also enjoyed privileges, including exemption from taxes and access to high offices.</li>
        <li><span class="special-word">The Third Estate:</span> Included the common people. This estate was further divided into three groups:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="special-word">Peasants:</span> Made up about 90% of the population but owned only a small portion of land. They were burdened with taxes and feudal dues.</li>
                <li><span class="special-word">Workers:</span> Included artisans, servants, and laborers. They lived in crowded cities and faced tough working conditions.</li>
                <li><span class="special-word">Middle Class:</span> Consisted of professionals such as lawyers, doctors, and merchants. They were well-educated and often frustrated by their lack of social mobility.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.2.2 The Struggle to Survive</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The population of France increased from 23 million in 1715 to 28 million in 1789.</li>
        <li>This led to a rapid increase in the demand for food grains.</li>
        <li>Production of grains could not keep up with the demand, resulting in increased prices of bread, the staple diet of the majority.</li>
        <li>Most workers were employed as laborers in workshops, and their wages did not keep pace with the rising prices.</li>
        <li><span class="special-word">Subsistence Crisis:</span> This economic hardship led to widespread discontent among the common people. A subsistence crisis occurs when basic means of livelihood are endangered, leading to severe hunger and poverty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.2.3 Growing Middle Class</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The eighteenth century witnessed the emergence of a new social group, the middle class.</li>
        <li>They were prosperous and educated individuals, including merchants, manufacturers, and professionals.</li>
        <li>The middle class believed in ideas of social equality and justice, inspired by philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</li>
        <li>They played a significant role in the revolution by demanding an end to privileges based on birth.</li>
    </ul>
