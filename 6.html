    <h1>1.6 The Abolition of Slavery</h1>

    <h2>1.6.1 The Triangular Slave Trade</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the most revolutionary social reforms of the Jacobin regime was the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.</li>
        <li>The colonies in the Caribbean – Martinique, Guadeloupe, and San Domingo – were important suppliers of commodities like sugar, coffee, and indigo.</li>
        <li>These products were cultivated using slave labor.</li>
        <li>France was involved in the <span class="special-word">Triangular Slave Trade:</span> This trade connected Europe, Africa, and the Americas. French merchants transported slaves from Africa to the American colonies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.6.2 The Conditions of Slaves</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Slaves were treated as the property of their masters and had no personal rights.</li>
        <li>They were subjected to extreme cruelty and harsh working conditions on plantations.</li>
        <li>There was a constant demand for more slaves due to high mortality rates and brutal working conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.6.3 The Abolition Movement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Convention, led by the Jacobins, passed laws to free the slaves in the French colonies in 1794.</li>
        <li>This decision was influenced by the growing abolitionist movement and the principles of equality and liberty promoted by the revolution.</li>
        <li>However, the abolition of slavery did not last long. Napoleon reintroduced slavery in 1802 to gain support from plantation owners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.6.4 Final Abolition of Slavery</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Slavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.</li>
        <li>This marked a significant step towards human rights and social justice.</li>
    </ul>
