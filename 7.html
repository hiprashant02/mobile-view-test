    <h2>1.7.3 New Forms of Address</h2>

        <li>The traditional forms of address such as ‘Monsieur’ (Sir) and ‘Madame’ (Madam) were replaced by the more egalitarian ‘Citizen’ (Citoyen) and ‘Citizens’ (Citoyenne).</li>
        <li>This change was meant to emphasize the idea of equality among all citizens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.7.4 Clothing</h2>

    <h2>1.7.5 The Revolutionary Calendar</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The revolutionary government introduced a new calendar to break away from the past and the influence of the Church.</li>
        <li>This calendar had 12 months, each consisting of 30 days, divided into three ten-day weeks called ‘decades’.</li>
        <li>The names of the months were derived from nature, such as ‘Vendémiaire’ (vintage), ‘Brumaire’ (fog), and ‘Frimaire’ (frost).</li>
        <li>However, this calendar was abolished by Napoleon in 1805.</li>
