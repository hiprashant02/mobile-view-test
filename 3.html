    <h1>1.3 The Outbreak of the Revolution</h1>

    <h2>1.3.1 The Estates-General</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>5 May 1789:</strong> Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates-General to pass proposals for new taxes.</li>
        <li><span class="special-word">Estates-General:</span> An assembly of representatives from all three estates.</li>
        <li><strong>Voting System:</strong> Traditionally, each estate had one vote. The Third Estate demanded that each representative have one vote, but the king rejected this proposal.</li>
        <li>This rejection led to the formation of the National Assembly by the Third Estate representatives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.3.2 The Tennis Court Oath</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>20 June 1789:</strong> The National Assembly was locked out of their meeting hall.</li>
        <li>They moved to a nearby indoor tennis court and took the <span class="special-word">Tennis Court Oath:</span> Vowing not to disperse until a new constitution was created.</li>
        <li>This event marked the first step towards the creation of a constitution in France.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.3.3 The Fall of the Bastille</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>14 July 1789:</strong> A significant event where people stormed the Bastille, a fortress-prison in Paris.</li>
        <li>The Bastille was a symbol of the king's despotic rule, and its fall marked the beginning of the French Revolution.</li>
        <li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> The commander of the Bastille was killed, prisoners were released, and the fortress was demolished.</li>
        <li>The fall of the Bastille ignited widespread rebellion across France, leading to the formation of a people's militia.</li>
    </ul>
