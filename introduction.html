    <h1>Chapter 1: Number Systems - Irrational Numbers</h1>
    
    <h2>1.2 Irrational Numbers</h2>
    
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p><strong>Irrational numbers</strong> are numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. In other words, they cannot be written in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. The decimal expansion of irrational numbers is non-terminating and non-repeating.</p>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Some common examples of irrational numbers include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The square root of any prime number, such as √2, √3, √5.</li>
        <li>The mathematical constant &pi; (Pi), which is approximately 3.14159...</li>
        <li>The mathematical constant e (Euler's number), which is approximately 2.71828...</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Properties of Irrational Numbers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a fraction.</li>
        <li>The decimal expansion of an irrational number goes on forever without repeating.</li>
        <li>The sum or difference of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.</li>
        <li>The product or quotient of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Important Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Determine whether the following numbers are rational or irrational: √2, 4.5, &pi;, -3.75, √16</p>
        <p><strong>Answer 1:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>√2: Irrational</li>
            <li>4.5: Rational (can be expressed as 9/2)</li>
            <li>&pi;: Irrational</li>
            <li>-3.75: Rational (can be expressed as -15/4)</li>
            <li>√16: Rational (since √16 = 4, a whole number)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Find the value of √3 + √5.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> √3 + √5 is an irrational number, so its value cannot be simplified further.</p>

        <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Prove that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer 3:</strong> Let x be a rational number and y be an irrational number. Assume their sum, s = x + y, is rational. Then, y = s - x. Since the difference of two rational numbers is rational, y would also be rational, contradicting the given that y is irrational. Thus, the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.</p>

        <p><strong>Question 4:</strong> If x = 3 - √2, find x<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer 4:</strong> x<sup>2</sup> = (3 - √2)<sup>2</sup> = 9 - 6√2 + 2 = 11 - 6√2.</p>

        <p><strong>Question 5:</strong> Find two irrational numbers whose sum is rational.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer 5:</strong> Let x = √2 and y = -√2. Both x and y are irrational. Their sum, x + y = √2 - √2 = 0, is rational.</p>

    <h2>Concept Understanding</h2>
    <p>Irrational numbers are an essential part of the real number system. They help complete the number line by filling in the gaps between rational numbers. Understanding irrational numbers and their properties is crucial for higher-level mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and calculus.</p>
