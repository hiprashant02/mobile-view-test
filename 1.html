    <h1>1.1 The French Revolution</h1>

    <h2>1.1.1 The Storming of the Bastille</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>14 July 1789:</strong> The city of Paris was in a state of alarm.</li>
        <li><strong>Royal Troops:</strong> The king had commanded troops to move into the city, causing panic.</li>
        <li><strong>Rumours:</strong> Spread that the king would order the army to open fire on citizens.</li>
        <li><strong>People's Militia:</strong> Around 7,000 men and women gathered in front of the town hall and decided to form a militia.</li>
        <li><strong>Search for Arms:</strong> They broke into government buildings to find arms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.1.2 The Rise of the Peopleâ€™s Militia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>March to the Bastille:</strong> Several hundred people marched towards the fortress-prison, the Bastille.</li>
        <li><strong>Armed Fight:</strong> The commander of the Bastille was killed, and prisoners were released (only seven in total).</li>
        <li><strong>Symbol of Despotism:</strong> The Bastille was hated as it represented the king's absolute power.</li>
        <li><strong>Destruction of Bastille:</strong> The fortress was demolished, and its stone fragments were sold as souvenirs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.1.3 The Beginning of Revolutionary Events</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rioting:</strong> Continued both in Paris and the countryside, largely in protest of high bread prices.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Perspective:</strong> Historians view this period as the start of a series of events leading to the king's execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Uncertainty:</strong> At the time, most people did not foresee the revolution leading to such drastic outcomes.</li>
