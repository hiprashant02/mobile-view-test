    <h1>1.5 Did Women Have a Revolution?</h1>

    <h2>1.5.1 The Role of Women</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>From the beginning, women were active participants in the events which brought about the French Revolution.</li>
        <li>They hoped that their involvement would pressurize the revolutionary government to introduce measures to improve their lives.</li>
        <li>Most women of the third estate had to work for a living. They sold vegetables, fruits, flowers, worked as seamstresses, laundresses, or as domestic servants.</li>
        <li>Working women also had to care for their families and were paid lower wages than men.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.5.2 Political Clubs and the Demands of Women</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To discuss and voice their interests, women started their own political clubs and newspapers.</li>
        <li>About sixty women’s clubs came up in different French cities.</li>
        <li>The most famous was the Society of Revolutionary and Republican Women.</li>
        <li>They demanded the same political rights as men, such as the right to vote, to be elected to the Assembly, and to hold political office.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.5.3 Laws for Women</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>During the Reign of Terror, the government issued laws ordering the closure of women’s clubs and banning their political activities.</li>
        <li>Women were not granted the same political rights as men.</li>
        <li>However, revolutionary governments introduced laws to improve the lives of women:
            <ul>
                <li>Schooling was made compulsory for all girls.</li>
                <li>Fathers could no longer force their daughters into marriage against their will.</li>
                <li>Marriage was made into a contract entered into freely and registered under civil law.</li>
                <li>Divorce was made legal, and could be applied for by both women and men.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.5.4 The Struggle Continues</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Women’s struggle for equal political rights, however, continued.</li>
        <li>It was finally in 1946 that women in France won the right to vote.</li>
    </ul>
